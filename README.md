This study examines the role of nutrition in predicting COVID-19 outcomes, focusing on the mortality and recovery rates across global populations. Using the "COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset," dietary metrics such as caloric, protein, and fat intake were analyzed to 
determine their impact on pandemic resilience. The project involved cleaning and transforming raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning tools including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
Results demonstrated that protein and caloric intake were the strongest predictors of recovery rates, while regions with low fat sully exhibited significantly higher mortality risks. These findings highlight the importance of integrating nutritional considerations 
into public health strategies to improve resilience during pandemics and other health crises.

Project Description

The datasets that are being used highlight the calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal), food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). The sets were taken from Kaggle and covers 170 
countries across 95 variables. The question we are trying to answer is how do dietary patterns influence Covid 19 mortality and recovery rates. We will be using heatmaps, OLS regression, Multiple Linear Regression, KNN Regression, Random Forest with and with RFECV, SVM
modeling and XGBoost to help us find what affects the mortality and recovery rates from Covid 19.
